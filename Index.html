		<h1> Chains of Harrow </h1>
		<p>"<strong> Harrow </strong> the monastic, the ritualist. Harrow is suffragan to the Void. Will you believe, Tenno? ".</p>

		<p>Dauntless and devout, the dark priest Harrow bestows upon his coven three virtues: salvation through sacrifice, redemption through vengeance, and ascension through defiance.Nemeses beware, for only death awaits. Enchain the tainted, silence their heresy, and deliver their tormented souls unto the Void's embrace. After the Orokin recovered the derelict Zariman and retrieved the Tenno children, Rell was yet again "cast out" from the rest of the Tenno, possibly due to the Orokin deeming Rell unfit for the combat duties they forced upon the other Tenno. Rell was eventually taken in by the precursors of the Red Veil. They studied his teachings about the dangers of the Void, eventually coming to call the Void entity he perceived as "The Indifference" or "The Lidless Eye". Rell preferred to call it "The Man in the Wall".</p>

		<p>Denied access to Margulis' cryosleep and the Dream that preserved the other Tenno, Rell eventually and willingly sacrificed himself in a ritual the Veil believed would seal The Indifference out of the mortal plane. Rell's spirit was bound to his Warframe, Harrow, which was then chained in the Red Veil's sacred temple in a Derelict.</p> 
        
        <p>Due to his prolonged life, Rell's spirit became splintered and separated from his vessel. While the Tenno try to recover the fragments of his mind, Rell repeatedly mentions that The Man in the Wall is listening to the Tenno and grows stronger from that. Lotus and Ordis, however, explains it away as Void induced delusions and loss of control over Transference. Eventually Palladino, Speaker of The Veil, asks Tenno to destroy the vessel, thus freeing the weakened Rell, so he would be able to "rest", and placing the burden of holding off The Indifference on all remaining Tenno.</p>

        <h2> Gameplay Tips & Skills </h2> 


		<p>To fully utilize Harrow to his maximum potential, there’s a bit of work that needs to go into the frame, which includes the understanding of its three abilities. First off, Harrow, like any Warframe, comes with several abilities. Its first is called ‘Condemn’, which allows Harrow to swing its thurible in order to cast a spectral afterimage that snares its targets and immobilizing them, while also granting Harrow a shield restore based on the level the warframe and the ability is.</p>

        <p>Up next comes the frames ability ‘Penance’, which allows Harrow to heal your team mates and gain a faster fire rate for all its weapons at the cost of its own shields. Since this does drain his overshields, it is suggested to wait before you can use both ‘Condemn’ and ‘Penance’ together.</p>
	     
	    <p>Next up his his third ability, ‘Thurible’, which allows Harrow to channel its energy in order to generate a buff, which restores energy based upon the duration of the channel, and the amount of energy sacrificed. This ability sees an increase in energy returned if Harrow lands headshot kills against your enemies. This ability helps both Harrow and his team if they are near by him, allowing him to act as an energy battery for them.Next up his his third ability, ‘Thurible’, which allows Harrow to channel its energy in order to generate a buff, which restores energy based upon the duration of the channel, and the amount of energy sacrificed.

	    <p>Last, but not least, is the frames ability ‘Covenant’. This ability allows Harrow to protect your nearby allies with an energy shield, which absorbs all incoming damage for a set amount of time, before giving Harrow and your team mates an increased critical chance bonus. Headshots also increase this ability and allow for it to become more lethal.</p>
